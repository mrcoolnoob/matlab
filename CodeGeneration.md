I see. It seems that you are getting an error when you try to use the Simulink Coder to generate code from your Simulink model that contains MEX S-functions. According to one of the web search resultsÂ³, this error may be caused by the toolbox path caching feature, which can interfere with the detection of the MEX files. You can try the following steps to fix the error:

- Run rehash toolboxcache at the MATLAB prompt, and then clear the checkbox under Start->Preferences->General->Toolbox path caching->Enable toolbox path cache.
- Restart MATLAB and Simulink, and try to generate code again using the Simulink Coder.

If this does not solve the problem, you may need to check the compatibility of your MEX S-functions with the Simulink Coder. As another web search resultÂ¹ explains, you need to follow some guidelines to debug and analyze the quality of your S-functions, such as using the ssSetErrorStatus function to report errors, and using the SS_OPTION_EXCEPTION_FREE_CODE option to avoid simulation overhead. You can also refer to the documentationÂ¹ for more details on how to debug C MEX S-functions. I hope this helps..

It seems that you want to generate a shared library (.so file) from Simulink code and use it to run a simulation on Linux. There are a few steps that you need to follow to achieve this:

- First, you need to configure Simulink to use a CMake toolchain definition that supports GCC on Linux. You can find more information on how to do this in the [Configure CMake Build Process](^1^) documentationÂ¹.
- Second, you need to enable the option 'Generate Code only' in the Code Generation pane of the Configuration Parameters dialog box. This will generate C/C++ code from your model without building it.
- Third, you need to use the packNGo function to create a zip file that contains all the files needed to compile the code on a different platform. You can find more information on how to do this in the [How to compile Windows generated code on a Linux machine?](^2^) answerÂ².
- Fourth, you need to extract the zip file on your Linux machine and modify the defines.txt file to add the '-D' flag before each macro. You also need to append the names of all the source files to the same line.
- Fifth, you need to use the GCC compiler with the '-shared' and '-fPIC' flags to create a shared library from the code. For example, you can use this command:

bash
gcc -shared -fPIC -DMODEL=vdp -DNUMST=2 .... vdp.c vdp_data.c classic_main.c -o libvdp.so


This will create a shared library named libvdp.so that you can use to run the simulation.

I hope this helps you with your task. If you have any further questions, please feel free to ask. ðŸ˜Š
